### Installing Nuxt UI

LandiNuxt depends on Nuxt UI. Follow the setup instructions on the [Nuxt UI official website](https://ui.nuxt.com/).

## Nuxt UI Configuration

Nuxt UI includes pre-configured settings for **Color Mode**, **Fonts**, and **TailwindCSS**. We recommend keeping these default configurations, as our components are optimized to work with them.

### Font Configuration

Currently, our components use the following font families:

```css
--font-family-inter: "Inter", sans-serif;
--font-family-lora: "Lora", serif;
--font-family-instrument: "Instrument Serif", serif;
--font-family-roboto: "Roboto", sans-serif;
```

For more details on theming, visit the [Nuxt UI Theme Guide](https://ui3.nuxt.dev/getting-started/theme).

## Additional Required Modules

In addition to Nuxt UI, you'll need the following modules for full component functionality:

- **Nuxt Image**: [Installation Instructions](https://image.nuxt.com/get-started/installation)
- **Vue Use Motion**: [Setup Guide](https://motion.vueuse.org/getting-started/nuxt)

## Using the Components

Once everything is set up, you're ready to go! Just copy and paste the component code from LandiNuxt into your project, and you’re all set to create stunning landing pages with ease.
