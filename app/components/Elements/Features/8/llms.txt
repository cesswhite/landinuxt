## Reference Documentation

When implementing this component, refer to the following official documentation:

- **Nuxt UI Documentation**: https://ui.nuxt.com/llms-full.txt
- **Nuxt 4 Documentation**: https://nuxt.com/llms-full.txt
- **Tailwind CSS v4 Documentation**: https://tailwindcss.com/

## Implementation Rules and Guidelines

When implementing this component, you MUST follow these rules strictly:

1. **Framework Version**: Use Nuxt 4 (not Nuxt 3). Nuxt 4 is the latest version with improved performance and features.
2. **Composition API**: Always use Vue 3 Composition API with `<script setup lang="ts">` syntax. Do not use Options API.
3. **UI Library**: Use Nuxt UI v4 components exclusively. Common components include: UButton, NuxtImg, USlideover, UCard, UBadge, UIcon, etc. Refer to the Nuxt UI documentation for component props and usage.
4. **Styling Framework**: Use Tailwind CSS v4 utility classes for all styling. Do not use inline styles or CSS modules. Apply classes directly to HTML elements using the `class` attribute.
5. **Responsive Design**: Implement mobile-first responsive design using Tailwind breakpoints: `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`, `xl:`, `2xl:`. Start with mobile styles and progressively enhance for larger screens.
6. **Dark Mode Support**: Always include dark mode variants using Tailwind's `dark:` prefix. Test both light and dark modes to ensure proper contrast and readability.
7. **Accessibility**: Include proper ARIA labels, semantic HTML elements (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, etc.), and ensure keyboard navigation works correctly. Use `aria-label` for icon-only buttons.
8. **Image Optimization**: Use `NuxtImg` component (not regular `<img>` tags) for all images. Set `loading="lazy"`, appropriate `alt` text, and use `format="webp"` when possible.
9. **Code Quality**: Write clean, readable, and maintainable code. Use meaningful variable names, add comments for complex logic, and follow Vue 3 and Nuxt 4 best practices.
10. **TypeScript**: Use TypeScript for type safety. Define proper types for props, emits, and composables. Use `lang="ts"` in script tags.
11. **Component Structure**: Follow Vue 3 Single File Component (SFC) structure: `<template>`, `<script setup>`, and optionally `<style>`. Keep components focused and reusable.
12. **Nuxt Auto-imports**: Leverage Nuxt 4's auto-imports feature. You don't need to import composables like `useState`, `useRoute`, or Nuxt UI components manually.


## Reference Component Code

This is the complete working code for this component. Use it as a reference:

```vue
<template>
  <!-- README

## Component Code Analysis

This is a Vue 3 Single File Component (SFC) designed for Nuxt 4 landing pages. The component structure follows these patterns:

- **Template Section**: Contains the HTML structure with Tailwind CSS classes for styling
- **Component Usage**: Utilizes Nuxt UI v4 components (UButton, NuxtImg, UIcon, etc.) which are auto-imported in Nuxt 4
- **Responsive Design**: Implements responsive breakpoints using Tailwind's mobile-first approach
- **Dark Mode**: Includes dark mode variants using the `dark:` prefix for theme switching
- **Accessibility**: Uses semantic HTML and ARIA attributes for screen readers and keyboard navigation
- **Performance**: Optimizes images with NuxtImg component and lazy loading

**Important**: This code is production-ready and follows Nuxt 4 best practices. Use it as a reference but adapt it to your specific needs.


## Technical Implementation Details

### Key Features:

- **Responsive Layout**: Uses Tailwind's responsive breakpoints (sm:, md:, lg:, xl:, 2xl:)
- **Component Library**: Leverages Nuxt UI v4 for consistent design system
- **Image Optimization**: Uses NuxtImg for automatic image optimization and lazy loading
- **Dark Mode Support**: Includes dark mode classes (dark:) for theme switching
- **Accessibility**: Proper semantic HTML and ARIA attributes

## Step-by-Step Implementation Guide

Follow these steps to implement this component in your Nuxt 4 project:

### Prerequisites
1. Ensure you have a Nuxt 4 project set up. If not, create one with: `npx nuxi@latest init my-project`
2. Install Nuxt UI v4: `npm install @nuxt/ui` or `pnpm add @nuxt/ui` or `yarn add @nuxt/ui`
3. Install Nuxt Image module: `npm install @nuxt/image` (if not already included with Nuxt UI)
4. Configure `nuxt.config.ts` to include the modules: `modules: ['@nuxt/ui', '@nuxt/image']`

### Implementation Steps
1. **Copy the Code**: Copy the entire component code from the "Reference Component Code" section above
2. **Create Component File**: Create a new `.vue` file in your project (e.g., `components/MyComponent.vue` or `app/components/MyComponent.vue`)
3. **Paste and Review**: Paste the code into your component file and review the structure
4. **Customize Content**: Replace placeholder text, images, and links with your actual content
5. **Adjust Styling**: Modify Tailwind classes to match your design system and color scheme
6. **Test Responsiveness**: Test the component at different breakpoints (mobile, tablet, desktop)
7. **Test Dark Mode**: Verify the component looks correct in both light and dark modes
8. **Verify Accessibility**: Test with keyboard navigation and screen readers
9. **Optimize Images**: Replace image URLs with your own optimized images
10. **Final Review**: Ensure all functionality works as expected before deploying

### Important Notes
- Nuxt 4 auto-imports components and composables, so you don't need manual imports
- All Nuxt UI components are available globally once `@nuxt/ui` is installed
- Tailwind CSS v4 is included with Nuxt UI v4, no separate installation needed
- The component uses TypeScript by default in Nuxt 4 projects



1. Copy the component code above
2. Paste it into your Nuxt 4 project
3. Ensure you have Nuxt UI v4 installed: `npm install @nuxt/ui`
4. Make sure Nuxt Image is configured: `npm install @nuxt/image`
5. Customize the content, colors, and styling to match your needs
6. Test the component in different screen sizes and dark mode
