## Critical Instructions for Claude

### Step 1: Read the LLM Instructions File

**IMPORTANT**: Before implementing this component, you MUST read and understand the `llms.txt` file in this same directory. This file contains:

- Complete implementation rules and guidelines
- Reference documentation links (Nuxt UI, Nuxt 4, Tailwind CSS v4)
- Detailed component code reference
- Step-by-step implementation guide
- Technical implementation details

**Action Required**: 
1. Locate and read the `llms.txt` file in this component's directory
2. Review all sections, especially "Implementation Rules and Guidelines"
3. Understand the reference code structure
4. Note the documentation URLs for reference during implementation

### Step 2: Verify Your Skills

**IMPORTANT**: Before starting implementation, review the `Skills.md` file in this directory to verify you have the required technical knowledge.

**Action Required**:
1. Read the `Skills.md` file completely
2. Self-assess your proficiency in each skill area:
   - Core Framework Knowledge (Vue 3, Nuxt 4, Nuxt UI v4, Tailwind CSS v4)
   - Advanced Technical Skills (TypeScript, Modern CSS, Responsive Design, Accessibility)
   - Performance Optimization
   - Component Architecture
3. If you lack proficiency in any essential skill, refer to the documentation links in `llms.txt` to fill knowledge gaps
4. Only proceed with implementation once you're confident in your skills

### Step 3: Implementation Context

You are helping to implement a cta component for a **Nuxt 4** landing page. This component should:

- Match the design shown in the reference image exactly
- Follow the code structure provided in `llms.txt`
- Adhere to all rules and guidelines specified in `llms.txt`
- Use the technical skills outlined in `Skills.md`

## Implementation Requirements

### Framework & Tools
1. **Use Nuxt 4** (not Nuxt 3) with Composition API (`<script setup lang="ts">`)
2. **Implement using Nuxt UI v4 components** exclusively
3. **Apply Tailwind CSS v4 utility classes** for all styling
4. **Ensure full responsiveness** across all screen sizes (mobile-first)
5. **Support dark mode** using Tailwind's `dark:` prefix
6. **Include proper accessibility attributes** (ARIA labels, semantic HTML)
7. **Optimize images** using `NuxtImg` component (never use `<img>` tags)
8. **Follow Vue 3 and Nuxt 4 best practices** as outlined in `llms.txt`

### Code Quality Standards
- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow the component structure patterns shown in `llms.txt`
- Leverage Nuxt 4's auto-imports (no manual imports needed)
- Ensure proper semantic HTML structure
- Include appropriate ARIA attributes for accessibility

## Reference Code

The complete reference code is available in the `llms.txt` file. Use it as your primary reference for:

- Component structure and organization
- Tailwind CSS class usage
- Nuxt UI component implementation
- Responsive design patterns
- Dark mode implementation
- Accessibility features

## Implementation Workflow

### Pre-Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Read and understood `llms.txt` file completely
- [ ] Reviewed and verified skills in `Skills.md` file
- [ ] Analyzed reference image for visual requirements
- [ ] Understood the reference code structure
- [ ] Have access to Nuxt UI, Nuxt 4, and Tailwind CSS v4 documentation

### Implementation Steps
1. **Analyze Requirements**: Review the reference image and understand the visual design
2. **Review Reference Code**: Study the code structure in `llms.txt` to understand patterns
3. **Check Skills**: Verify you have all required skills from `Skills.md`
4. **Implement Component**: Create the component following all rules from `llms.txt`
5. **Ensure Responsiveness**: Test at all breakpoints (mobile, tablet, desktop)
6. **Test Dark Mode**: Verify appearance in both light and dark modes
7. **Verify Accessibility**: Test with keyboard navigation and screen readers
8. **Optimize Performance**: Ensure images are optimized and code is efficient
9. **Code Review**: Review your implementation against the rules in `llms.txt`
10. **Final Testing**: Test all functionality and visual appearance

### Quality Assurance
